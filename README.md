# Travel Destination Suggestion Platform

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Travel Destination Suggestion Platform. The goal is to build a user-friendly platform where users can get personalized travel recommendations based on preferences such as budget, duration, and travel type (e.g., solo, family, honeymoon).

## 1. Planning and Setup (Week 1-2)

**Objective**: Define features, tech stack, and project structure.

**Tasks**:
- Identify user requirements (e.g., solo, family, honeymoon travel types).
- Set up project repositories and initial environment.
- Finalize tech stack (Python/Django, React.js, MySQL, GPT-2).

---

## 2. Backend Development (Week 2-4)

**Objective**: Develop backend features (APIs, database).

**Tasks**:
- Create Django models for users, destinations, and reviews.
- Set up MySQL database.
- Build API endpoints for user registration, destination search, and reviews.
- Integrate GPT-2 for personalized recommendations.

## 3. Frontend Development (Week 4-6)

**Objective**: Build a responsive frontend interface.

**Tasks**:
- Design UI for destination search, recommendations, and reviews.
- Develop React components for key pages (e.g., homepage, destination details, profile).
- Implement filtering options (budget, duration, type of travel).
- Connect frontend with backend APIs.

## 4. Review and Ratings System (Week 6-7)

**Objective**: Implement review and ratings functionality.

**Tasks**:
- Allow users to submit ratings and text reviews for destinations.
- Display reviews with filtering options (e.g., by rating or date).
- Ensure moderation for inappropriate content.

---

## 5. Testing and Bug Fixing (Week 7-8)

**Objective**: Test all features and fix bugs.

**Tasks**:
- Perform unit testing for backend models and APIs.
- Conduct integration testing between frontend and backend.
- Test UI responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Fix bugs and optimize performance.

---

## 6. Deployment and Scaling (Week 9-10)

**Objective**: Deploy the project to production and ensure scalability.

**Tasks**:
- Deploy backend (Django app) on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean.
- Deploy frontend (React app) on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
- Set up MySQL in production (e.g., AWS RDS).
- Implement continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD).
- Monitor performance and scale infrastructure as needed.

---

## 7. Post-Launch (Ongoing)

**Objective**: Monitor and iterate based on user feedback.

**Tasks**:
- Collect user feedback through reviews and surveys.
- Fix bugs and improve features based on feedback.
- Optimize performance and scaling.
- Plan for new features or updates (e.g., multi-destination itineraries).
